Efficient Rendering for Light Field Displays using Tailored Projective Mappings

About using our code:
You must add in your specific display calibration values per hand in lightfield.h->Lightfield::setLightfieldParameters()
For the Looking Glass these can be found under /LKG_calibration/visual.json

You can toggle between our algorithm and the standard procedure by pressing T -> Our algorithm is the default
You can move the window to the light field display and back by pressing M
You can view timers and debug information like the individual textures by pressing F1
